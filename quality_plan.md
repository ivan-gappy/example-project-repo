## Software Quality Plan

### 1. Usability
Users must be able to easily navigate the interface. We'll conduct early usability testing and keep the UI consistent across devices.

### 2. Maintainability
Code will be modular and well-documented. We'll enforce coding standards and use version control to support future updates.

### 3. Performance
The application should respond within 2 seconds. Weâ€™ll optimize database queries and test response times regularly.
