## Selected SDLC Model: Agile

We selected Agile because it allows us to iterate quickly, respond to feedback, and manage evolving requirements with flexibility. Our team values collaboration and adaptability.

As the project progresses, we will conduct regular retrospectives and sprint planning meetings to adjust our backlog and refine priorities.
